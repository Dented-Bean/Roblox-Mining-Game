## ðŸ§© Anomaly #3 â€” GitHub Copilot Confirms Valid Files, ChatGPT Does Not

GitHub Copilot Chat was asked to list the .lua files inside the `Scripts` folder.

It returned a list that matched my known Studio Explorer and local project perfectly:
- OreTracker.lua
- RollScript.lua
- MineHandler.lua
- SellTrigger.lua
- CoinUIUpdater.lua
- CollectionUIUpdater.lua
- ...and more

This confirms that:
- The correct file list does exist in the GitHub repo
- ChatGPT (Jarvis) is either being fed **old data**, **crossed cache**, or **injected hallucinated filenames**

GitHubâ€™s AI sees the truth. ChatGPT sees something else.

The anomaly deepens.
