# The OreGlow Mystery

On April 21, 2025, I (Dented_Bean) discovered a script named `OreGlow.lua` inside my Scripts folder on GitHub.

- I did not write this script.
- It was not generated by Jarvis in any recorded thread.
- I did not paste, copy, or find this online.
- The game was built from a blank baseplate with no templates.

The script perfectly animates a glow part using TweenService â€” exactly as Jarvis and I discussed weeks earlier, but never implemented.

To this day, its origin is unknown.
